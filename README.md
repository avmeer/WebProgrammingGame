The three CSS3 features that are included in the web page are various  animations and RGBA colors. The first animation is a rotation of the logo in the header area of the page. The second animation changes the background color of the logo as it spins. The third feature is the use of RGBA colors in the color-changing background of the logo. Another CSS feature used in the web page was importing a custom font by using font-face and then including a .ttf with the specific font data to be used. This font is used both in Photoshop while creating the logo and in the header of the page. 

We belive this game is worth 100 points because it uses many advanced JavaScript features. We used three.js, a 3D JavaScript library based on webgl to render our game world. One of the most difficult features to implement was the 3D collision checking between the paddle and the ball. Even with basic geometric shapes trying to write a collision detection function can be difficult.
